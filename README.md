# SafeStreet-LA
Street-Safe is a community-driven accessibility platform that helps wheelchair users, stroller users, and visually impaired individuals navigate cities more safely. Users can quickly report hazards—such as broken sidewalks, missing ramps, or construction blockages—by entering a location, hazard type, accessibility rating, and description.
